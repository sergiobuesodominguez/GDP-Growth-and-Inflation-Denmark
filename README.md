Forecasting Inflation in Denmark Using GDP and Inflation Data
This project explores the relationship between GDP growth and inflation in Denmark by applying time series analysis techniques. The primary goal is to forecast future trends in inflation using historical data on GDP growth and inflation rates. The analysis uses a variety of statistical methods, including data cleaning, correlation analysis, regression modeling, and forecasting with a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model.

Key Features
Data processing: Cleaning and reshaping raw GDP and inflation data into a usable format.
Year-over-year analysis: Calculating year-over-year differences to focus on trends and remove noise from the data.
Visualization: Creating plots to compare GDP growth and inflation over time, as well as their changes year-over-year.
Statistical analysis: Calculating correlations and performing regression analysis to understand the relationship between GDP growth and inflation.
Forecasting: Using the VAR model to forecast future GDP growth and inflation trends for the next 5 years.
